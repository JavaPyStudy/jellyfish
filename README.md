# jellyfish
This repository is inspired by Quinn Liu's repository Walnut and share similar goal/approach with it.

This is the prime repository of the organization JellAIfish, the aim is to develop a artificial general intelligence.

Q - Why the name "jellyfish" though? 
A - Obsession.

Q - Why the obsession?
A - cause jellyfishes are nature's AI.

Q - ??
A - 21st century - every neuroscience researcher in the world has once in his/her lifetime dreamt of developing an AGI. A few of them have made some decent progress as well. Everyone wants to build an AGI - an artificial general inteligence, a machine with no inherent conscience that can perform basic tasks that human can without any supervision. A machine with supposedly no biological brain at its core but still manages to be at par with human cognition. 
Though jellyfishes are neither "artificial" nor have "intelligence" they form a great analogy. These biologically brainless creatures have managed to roam the earth for the more than 500 million years while we were first sighted around 200,000 years ago. A species of jellyfish - "Turritopsis dohrnii" has even managed to cross the mortality barrier. 

Even without a biological brain they've managed to survive and perform basic tasks required for survival. In contrast AGI (once fully developed)'s congnizance might very soon surpass that of human's. The cool thing (for us) about these jellyfishes is that these jellyfishes evaporate once they are washed on shore which is unlikely to happen with any AGI. Another cool analogy (not for us) is that neither AGI nor jellyfish *have a heart.*
