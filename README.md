# jellyfish
This repository is inspired by Quinn Liu's repository Walnut and share similar goal/approach with it.

This is the prime repository of the organization JellAIfish, the aim is to develop a artificial general intelligence.

Q - Why the name "jellyfish" though?
A - Obsession.

Q - Why the obsession?
A - cause jellyfishes are nature's AI.

Q - ??
A - 21st century - every neuro-science researcher in the world has once in his/her lifetime dreamt of developing an AGI.
 
A few of them have made some decent progress as well. Everyone wants to build an AGI - an artificial general intelligenc
e
, a machine with no inherent conscience that can perform basic tasks that human can without any supervision. A machine 
with supposedly no biological brain at its core but still manages to be at par with human cognition. 
Though jellyfishes are neither "artificial" nor have "intelligence" they form a great analogy. These biologically 
brainless creatures have managed to roam the earth for the more than 500 million years while we were first sighted aroun
d 200,
000 years ago. A species of jellyfish - "Turritopsis dohrnii" has even managed to cross the mortality barrier. 

Even without a biological brain they've managed to survive and perform basic tasks required for survival. In contrast AG
I (once fully developed)'s cognizance might very soon surpass that of human's. The cool thing (for us) about these 
jellyfishes is that these jellyfishes evaporate once they are washed on shore which is unlikely to happen with any AGI. 
Another cool analogy (not for us) is that neither AGI nor jellyfish *have a heart.*

## Why github?
Like Q Liu I want to make my research and efforts for building an AGI available for the mass. Hence the repository and the idea of using the issue page for research and coping up with the hurdles that will come along.
Like most of the repository structure this idea is inspired by Q as well.


## Getting started
_Let's start with a story to begin with._

In 1681, English theologian Thomas Burnet published Sacred Theory of the Earth, in which he explained how geology worked
. What happened was, around 6,000 years ago, the Earth was formed as a perfect sphere with a surface of idyllic land and
 a watery interior. But then, when the surface dried up a little later, cracks formed in its surface, releasing much of 
the water from within. The result was the Biblical Deluge and Noah having to deal with a ton of shit all week. Once thin
gs settled down, the Earth was no longer a perfect sphere—all the commotion had distorted the surface, bringing about 
mountains and valleys and caves down below, and the whole thing was littered with the fossils of the flood’s victims.

And bingo. Burnet had figured it out. The great puzzle of fundamental theology had been to reconcile the large number of
 seemingly-very-old Earth features with the much shorter timeline of the Earth detailed in the Bible. For theologians of
 the time, it was their version of the general relativity vs. quantum mechanics quandary, and Burnet had come up with a 
viable string theory to unify it all under one roof.

It wasn’t just Burnet. There were enough theories kicking around reconciling geology with the verses of the Bible to 
today warrant a 15,000-word “Flood Geology” Wikipedia page.

Around the same time, another group of thinkers started working on the geology puzzle: scientists.

For the theologian puzzlers, the starting rules of the game were, “Fact: the Earth began 6,000 years ago and there was
 at one point an Earth-sweeping flood,” and their puzzling took place strictly within that context. But the scientists
 started the game with no rules at all. The puzzle was a blank slate where any observations and measurements they found 
were welcome.

Over the next 300 years, the scientists built theory upon theory, and as new technologies brought in new types of 
measurements, old theories were debunked and replaced with new updated versions. The science community kept surprising 
themselves as the apparent age of the Earth grew longer and longer. In 1907, there was a huge breakthrough when American
 
scientist Bertram Boltwood pioneered the technique of deciphering the age of rocks through radiometric dating, which fou
nd
elements in a rock with a known rate of radioactive decay and measured what portion of those elements remained intact an
d 
what portion had already converted to decay substance.

Radiometric dating blew Earth’s history backwards into the billions of years, which burst open new breakthroughs in 
science like the theory of Continental Drift, which in turn led to the theory of Plate Tectonics. The scientists were on
 a
 roll.

Meanwhile, the flood geologists would have none of it. To them, any conclusions from the science community were moot 
because they were breaking the rules of the game to begin with. The Earth was officially less than 6,000 years old, so i
f 
radiometric dating showed otherwise, it was a flawed technique, period.

But the scientific evidence grew increasingly compelling, and as time wore on, more and more flood geologists threw in t
he towel and accepted the scientist’s viewpoint-maybe they had had the rules of the game wrong.

In our feat to achieve the impossible (developing an AGI) maybe we have the rules of the games all wrong to start with. 
Maybe the current approach is the one followed by the theologian puzzlers. We need to start with no rules at all. That 
is where the idea of building things from the ground up kicks in. 
  
This organization is meant to debunk those rules which we have subconsciously set, but for contradicting something such 
widespread like the current classical machine learning algorithms we need to first understand what we are really up 
against. We start by covering areas which are already in being investigated by classical machine learning engineers -
* Computer vision
* Language Processing
* ??

For developing an AGI from ground up the answer lies in neurology - 
* Brain computer interfaces.
* Neural Lace
* Human psychology??

# Contribution
Though this open source repository is meant for expressing the ideas,views and issues with the current classical methods anyone can raise an issue and send a PR as per his understanding, but if you want to have a deep overview on the 
 subject with the members of the organization or you wish to be a member of this organization, drop me a mail at 
 mrmohitrathoremr@gmail.com . 
 
 Read at least one research paper a day and make notes.

# Attribution 
Q Liu planted the idea of designing AGI for the better good of humanity. Some theories that he extended to me are - 
* The idea of first principle thinking. 
* [That there is no free will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCofmZlC72g&t=1035s)[.](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/issues/294#issuecomment-253239773) - Do you believe in Chaos Theory?.

and the two interview questions -  
* What truth do you believe in that very few people agree with you on?
* Tell me the story of your life and why you made the decisions you made and tell me about how you solved the hardest 
problems you have faced?
